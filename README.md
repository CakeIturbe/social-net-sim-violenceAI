# Social Network Simulator with AI-Powered Violence Content Filtering
This web application simulates a social networking platform with an integrated custom AI model that detects and filters out violent visual content in real time. The project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be used to create safer online spaces by automatically moderating user-uploaded images and videos.

## Key Features
AI-Based Filtering: Custom-trained model that identifies and blocks violent content.
Simulated Social Network: Users can create posts, upload media, and interact as on a real platform.
Real-Time Moderation: Content is automatically scanned and flagged before being displayed.
Customizable AI Backend: Easily swap in your own model or retrain with new datasets.
Privacy & Ethics Focused: Designed with transparency and responsible AI use in mind.

## Tech Stack
Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express
AI Model: Python (TensorFlow / PyTorch) served via API
Storage: Firebase 

## Use Cases
Education & demos of AI content moderation
Prototypes for safe-by-design social platforms
Research on ethics and performance of AI in content filtering
